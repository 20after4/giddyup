If you use bundler for your gem management, it's fairly simple to keep the
gems up to date when you deploy your application, like this:

############
# START HOOK

# Run all this before you start your appservers

. /usr/local/lib/giddyup/functions.sh

share vendor/bundle

cd $RELEASE
bundle install --deployment
