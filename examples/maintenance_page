If you like to put up a maintenance page while you're doing deployments, the
following will do it simply and easily.  Several assumptions are made:

* Your maintenance page lives at public/system/maintenance.html in your Git
  repo.  This is important, so that when the symlink moves from the existing
  release to the new one, the site doesn't magically spring back to life
* The maintenance page is "active" when it's at
  public/system/maintenance.html, and we keep it at
  public/system/maintenance.html.disabled when it's not in use.  Adjust
  paths to suit your local circumstances.

###########
# STOP HOOK

# Run this before you stop your appservers:

mv current/public/system/maintenance.html.disabled current/public/system/maintenance.html || true


############
# START HOOK

# Run this after you start your appservers, and preferably after you've
# tested that they're actually ready to serve requests again

mv current/public/system/maintenance.html current/public/system/maintenance.html.disabled
