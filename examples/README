This directory contains a pile of example snippets for hooks you can use in
your application's giddyup deployment process.  Each one has some
explanatory text, then the snippets you can cut-and-paste into your own
deployment hooks.

There is also a directory called `rackctl`, which contains the scripts I
used to manage multiple rack applications with thin and daemontools.  The
README in that directory contains more details.
