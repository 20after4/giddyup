This directory contains a pile of example snippets for hooks you can use in
your application's giddyup deployment process.  Each one has some
explanatory text, then the snippets you can cut-and-paste into your own
deployment hooks.

There is also a directory called `rackctl`, which contains the scripts I use
on my own servers to manage multiple rack applications with thin and
daemontools.  The README in that directory contains more details.

I actively integrate example hook scripts that people contribute; a store of
these hooks is important to demonstrate what is possible with giddyup.  If
you have any hooks you'd like to share, please e-mail them to
<theshed+giddyup@hezmatt.org>.
